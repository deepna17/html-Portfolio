<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I'm Deepna SR, a Full Stack Developer who loves crafting cool stuff for the web. I'm all about making user experiences
   smooth and awesome, whether it's the front end or the back end.
<br />
  Background:<br />
  Originally from a lively coastal town called Kannur in Kerala, I got into Full Stack Development because I'm curious about tech and love making things that people can use. I studied Computer Science Engineering at Yenepoya Institute Of Technology, Mangalore, where I learned a lot both in class and through hands-on experience.
  <br />
  Skills:<br />
  I know a bunch of tech stuff like:
  <br />
  For making websites look good: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular
  For making the magic happen behind the scenes: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, SQL
  Plus, I'm handy with C, JAVA, Git, and making web services talk to each other using RESTful APIs.
  <br />
  Experience:<br />
  I've worked as a Full Stack Developer at AiRoboSoft in Bangalore. It was a great learning experience where I got to work on cool projects and meet awesome people.
  <br />
  Passions and Interests:<br />
  Besides coding, I love checking out new tech, going to tech events, and keeping up with what's hot in the industry. I'm also big on giving back to the community through mentoring and volunteering.
  <br />
  Future Goals:<br />
  I'm always looking to improve my skills and learn new things in Full Stack Development. Whether it's diving deeper into cloud computing, mastering new frameworks, or even starting my own tech venture, I'm up for the challenge!</p>
